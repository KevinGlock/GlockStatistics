		<p>	My name is Kevin Glock. I come from a beautiful city in Westphalia and settled in Duisburg during my studies.
			I am currently completing my master's degree in tranquil Bamberg in the middle of Franconia and commuting between Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia.
			I love good food, good books, films and the sea.
		</p>
		
		<p>	Before I started my basic studies, I completed a basic education in the pedagogical area,
			but afterwards I decided to do a high school diploma at the evening college, that I completed a "blended learning" course,
			so that I had several years of professional experience in social pedagogy and nursing pedagogy before my studies.
			I was able to collect areas and acquired competencies in dealing with digital teaching and learning concepts at an early stage.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			During this time I have been interested in research and science for a long time and in my spare time and work I have increased my knowledge in pedagogy,
			development & learning psychology, educational research and social research.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This knowledge was useful in my bachelor's degree, which enabled me to accompany and support many students.
			So I was on hand with advice and support in the methodical implementation and evaluation and successfully helped with a number of exam preparations,
			seminar work and theses. All were passed, whether seminar, bachelor, master thesis or dissertation.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			My focus is on general communication of the logic of science and research, as well as the acquisition of education in the course of study,
			so that I can later tackle methodological problems independently.
			The aim should be to discuss difficulties in methodical implementations and evaluations,
			to explain them clearly and to solve them. Always with a very high technical standard, but simple,
			understandable and explained using everyday examples and your specific content.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In addition to my bachelor's degree, I have always worked outside of the university.
			This gave me a very comprehensive insight into various professional fields.
			I was also involved in teaching as a tutor for methods of empirical social research and computer-aided statistics with SPSS.
			In the further course of my bachelor's degree, I worked as a student assistant in a research project that dealt with the preparation,
			distribution and statistical and qualitative evaluation of text data using the R programming language.
			As part of the project, the main focus of my work was on measurement-theoretical aspects (reliability and validity of the data), data management and theoretical work.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			As part of my master’s degree, I am now deepening my knowledge of data collection, management and analysis.
			The main focus is on mathematical statistics and an analytical-mathematical solution to problems.
			Just as extensive is the deepening of measurement theory problems and computer-aided work.
			So I deepen my knowledge in R, Stata, statistical schools (classic, Bayesian), simulations, variance estimates and much more.
			In addition to my master's degree, I am currently working at the Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories and focus on interdisciplinary returns on education
			from a social and economic perspective. The focus of my work here is more on methodological aspects (measurement theory, data quality, data management) than on content issues.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			My basic education is shaped by social sciences, but my interests are broad and cover natural sciences, education, social research in general, psychology, economic development,
			complex systems and methodological research.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		    Like to look around!
